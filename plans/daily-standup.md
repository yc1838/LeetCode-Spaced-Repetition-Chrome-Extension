# Daily Standup

### Date: 2026-02-06
- Done:
  - Initialized Scrum guard planning docs (`sprint-plan.md`, `change-log.md`, `daily-standup.md`, `parking-lot.md`).
  - Defined a focused sprint target around release stability and store-readiness.
  - Replaced privacy policy contact placeholders with real email and GitHub issues URL.
- Next:
  - Host `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` at a public URL for Chrome Web Store submission.
  - Run `npm run build` and `npm test`, then verify `dist/background.js` integrity and service-worker load health.
  - Audit/produce required extension icons and finalize manifest/store packaging checklist.
- Blockers:
  - Public hosted privacy-policy URL is not set yet.
- Risk: at-risk
