- Change: Moved the streak-fix tool from popup sidebar into the options/setup page as a dedicated tool card at the end, and removed popup streak-repair wiring.
- Reason: Keep popup focused on daily review/scan flow while keeping manual maintenance actions in setup.
- Impact: Popup is less cluttered, and streak repair is now available in options with explicit date input, validation, and status feedback.

- Change: Refactored manual drill generation into a queue-refill flow (targeted pending count, cooldown, queue cleanup/rotation, dedupe, and per-skill/per-type caps), and updated options UI/status copy to match the new behavior.
- Reason: Prevent queue bloat and duplicate drills while making refill results predictable and visible to users.
- Impact: Refill now tops up to queue target instead of blind bulk generation, stale/duplicate pending drills are cleaned, and settings UI shows realtime queue state plus explicit fallback reasons.
- Scope Decision: in-scope
